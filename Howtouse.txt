In this blog, we are going to see how we can generate advance test report such as net-master for cucumber using Maven-cucumber-reporting, an open source tool which generates pretty html report along with living documentation.

For More Details on this report you can visit there official Git Page.

Please Note before starting setup of this report I am assuming you have basic knowledge of maven, and it is already installed in local machine as well as in your ide along with all other maven plugin to execute test.

Let’s check out how we can generate this report using cucumber maven Plugin.

<phase>test</phase>
<goals>
<goal>generate</goal>
</goals>
<configuration>
<projectName>Project Name</projectName>
<outputDirectory>${project.build.directory}/Report/cucumber-reports</outputDirectory>
<cucumberOutput>${project.build.directory}/cucumber/cucumber.json</cucumberOutput>
<skippedFails>true</skippedFails>
<enableFlashCharts>false</enableFlashCharts>
</configuration>
</execution>
</executions>
</plugin>

    2)   In the Runner File inside plugin tag add name of the report

plugin= {"pretty","html:target/site/cucumber-pretty",
